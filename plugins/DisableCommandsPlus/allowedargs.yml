#NOTE: Do not disable commands in any other configs but this config
#If you want to disable commands with args


#Here is the file that you use to disable the primary command
#But allow certain args with the command!

#Example: Disable the command /warp, /warp spawn, etc but allow players to use /warp pvp, /warp arena1, etc.


#Place all users here that you don't want anything in this config to apply to!
userCanUseAllArgs:




#Place all commands to disable WITHOUT ARGS!!  If the command is not here and in args: list then the command
#Won't be disabled!!!
primaryCommandsToDisable:
#- warp
#- kit
#- help


#Place all the args that you disabled here
#If they use the startCommand + the args disabled in this list, then it will be cancelled!
#Or if they use the startCommand by itself!
#Any player placed in the usersToIgnore: list can use all other args, even if they aren't in the args: list
#NOTE!!! If the startCommand: is different then the command you are trying to disable args from, then this won't work!
#NOTE!!! You need to keep startCommand: the same as the command you disable the args from!
#messageToSend: is the message you want to tell the players when they do an arg in the list of disabled args.
#Follow these 3 examples!
